You can find the Convet tools from the link.

## How to use
I use the opencv2 lib and ncnn lib in the 3rdParty folde. You can open the .sln program file, and debug or run. Then model file in the Darknet_model2 folder. If you wan't to run the tiny-yolo2.exe file, you must put the folder and the pictures in the same folder, and then run the .`exe` in the `cmd`.
